        <h3 class="is title is-5 is-black">Summary</h3>


        <p>- Flexible workspaces are ones of the most affected segment of real estate<br>
- The French gov't put some measures (March, 25th) to help both spaces and landlords (with respect to their mortgage obligations)<br>
- If contracts contain a clause of force majeure, it may be applicable here.<br>

Hello, I'm Benjamin one of the founders of coworkintel, the 

authoritative source on premium operational performance data

for flexible workspaces. Today,

we have Mickaël Haik, lawyer at the Paris and Quebec bars

Hello Mickaël! Hello. Mickaël, you are a specialized lawyer

in real estate law. First of all, what is your impression

on the impact of the virus on real estate, both traditional -

long and flexible leases, commercial real estate. Well, it's always

a little bit difficult to say because we're in the middle of it.

The experts themselves are divided on the issue. Some believe that the impact

will be very important and others much less. So on commercial premises because

this is the question you are asking me, confinement will cause difficulties. Why ?

Because confinement leads to a drop in activity

economic. We also note that the shops and restaurants are closed

So many companies will experience economic difficulties.

They will no longer be able to pay their commercial rent, which will put the owners in difficulty, who in turn will no longer be able to repay their credit.

what will make them sell, we will have an increase in supply with a

declining demand because there will be far fewer people who will want to buy

commercial premises and they have much less ease

credit. Besides, we will see how the banks react

but you can contact now that they have stopped the loans and interest rates have already started to rise.

We think they will stay low but we will see. On short leases - coworkings -

it's even more problematic because the main tenants

who rents commercial premises and then sublet them, must face their

tenants who do not pay their rents but they will see a number

much more important because it's short leases

with termination periods in general of one month and therefore the sub-tenants who will see the covid-19 and the difficulties they will face

one of the first things they will do is to terminate their short lease

so coworking managers will be even more impacted

In any case, the consequences of the covid on real estate will depend greatly on the duration of the confinement

Thank you very clear, times are tough for coworks. Can we maybe take

a little perspective because it sometimes helps to put things into perspective,

Do you know eras or crises, we

can call precedents, of this period which their

would look like. So health crisis, I don't see too many examples. Because we have the Spanish flu

1919 in the head but it is not at all the same thing. Perhaps SARS in 2002-2003 but in France we were not too impacted

especially in Paris, it continued to increase, I think that if we have to think of real estate crises, it is that

from 90-97, where there was a 50 percent drop in prices in the capital which is extremely important. In 2008, however, notably

in Paris, we were not too impacted because there is such a housing crisis

that there hadn't been too much impact. I do not think so

finally that the covid-19 will have a huge impact in the long term in any case on real estate or in the medium term

I am quite confident about the future. Well, now we will see it is always very difficult

to compare this situation with a previous one because

it's fairly new. Okay, in this interim period

before that before the market eventually recovers

What do you think are legal mitigation measures that can help

operator and donors to overcome this crisis? So,

we already have measures - orders that have been

taken. There is one in particular from March 25, which came to suspend for some companies

- usually small - the consequences of not paying rent

it means that if the tenant does not pay the commercial rent

between March 12 and 2 months after the cessation of the state of health emergency and

well they will have no financial penalty there is no

interest on delay, damage and interest, on-call, and we cannot use the resolutory clause against them

the famous clause which allows to end the commercial lease due to

absence of payment. You should know that even if this order

is ultimately to allow a deferral of rent without

penalty the rent will still be due anyway.

So this measure helps tenants. We also

a measure to help homeowners, another order dated March 25

which provided that the resolutory clauses, these famous clauses which allow the banks to terminate the loan contract and therefore to demand the whole of the loan amount,

well this order suspended this type of clause, that is to say that

if you are the owner you can no longer meet your loan, we will not be able to

oppose a termination clause, so suddenly

you will not be forced to sell right away.

So, finally, these two measures

greatly limit the impact of covid-19 on real estate

immovable. After there are a number of others

measures: aid to businesses, subsidies, loans at very low rates

There are a number of steps that are being taken in the right direction to support the real estate market

Indeed can we speak of a particular clause for

to finish is the force majeure clause. What is that

that this clause and do you think it applies?

The force majeure clause is a clause allowing the contractor

not to respect his obligations in a very event

particular: an event that is completely unpredictable,

irresistible and external to the person concerned.

So it can apply in our case

We can say: here, I cannot benefit from such a right and I cannot respect such an obligation because of the situation.

So force majeure can absolutely apply in

some situations not in others therefore after it will have to be applied on a case by case basis.

Thank you very much, it's good to hear.

With that, I wish you confinement as short as possible.

It was a pleasure, see you soon!
