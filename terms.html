        <h2 class="mb-4">11. Indemnities</h2>
        <span class="subheading">11.1</span>
        <p>CI shall indemnify you against all damages and costs finally awarded against you by a court of competent jurisdiction and/or amounts paid by you further to a final settlement approved by TI, together with associated legal fees reasonably incurred by you, as a result of any claim by a third party that the access and use, in accordance with this Agreement, by you of any Product and/or the Service infringes the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply in respect of any claim to the extent such claim arises as a result of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) the use or combination of any Product and/or the Service with equipment, software, material or services not supplied by CI or of which CI was not aware;</li>
          <li>b) modification to any Product and/or the Service carried out by anyone other than TI;</li>
          <li>c) CI complying with any design, specification or instructions provided by you or on your behalf;</li>
          <li>d) any Customer Data and/or Customer Materials; or</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">11.2</span>
        <p>If your access or use, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, of any Product and/or the Service is, or in CI's reasonable opinion is likely to become, enjoined as a result of a claim for which CI is obliged to indemnify you further to clause 10.1, then CI shall, at its sole option, and at its own cost and expense, make all reasonable efforts, as soon as reasonably possible to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) procure for you the continuing right to access and use such Product and/or the Service (as the case may be), in accordance with this Agreement, without infringement; or</li>
          <li>b) replace or modify such Product and/or the Service with software and/or services of substantially equivalent specification so as to avoid the infringement; and provided CI does so, it shall have no further liability to you in respect of the infringement claim.</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">11.3</span>
        <p>The indemnity in clause 11.1 shall be conditional upon:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) Your promptly notifying CI in writing of any claim which is subject to the indemnity;</li>
          <li>b) Your ensuring that no admission as to liability or any settlement or compromise of any such claim is made without the prior written consent of TI; and</li>
          <li>c) CI being entitled, upon request and at its cost and expense, to assume exclusive conduct of such claim (which shall include the right to conduct any proceedings or action in relation to, negotiate the settlement of, and to conduct all discussions and dispute resolution efforts in connection).</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">11.4</span>
        <p>You shall indemnify CI against all loss or damage that it incurs or suffers as a result of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) any Customer Data or CI's use and/or possession, in accordance with this Agreement, of any Customer Materials; and/or</li>
          <li>b) any claim by a third party as a result of your use of any Product and/or the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mb-4">12. Liability</h2>
        <span class="subheading">12.1</span>
        <p>Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes either party's liability:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) for death or personal injury caused by its negligence;</li>
          <li>b) for fraudulent misrepresentation or for any other fraudulent act or omission;</li>
          <li>c) to pay sums properly due and owing to the other in the normal course of performance of this Agreement; or</li>
          <li>d) for any other liability which may not lawfully be excluded or limited.</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">12.2</span>
        <p>Subject to clause 12.1, CI shall not be liable (whether from breach of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise) for any:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>(a) loss of profit;</li>
          <li>(b) loss of sales, turnover, revenue or business;</li>
          <li>(c) loss of customers, contracts or opportunity;</li>
          <li>(d) loss of or damage to reputation or goodwill;</li>
          <li>(e) loss of anticipated savings;</li>
          <li>(f) loss of any software or data;</li>
          <li>(g) loss of use of hardware, software or data;</li>
          <li>(h) loss or waste of management or other staff time; or</li>
          <li>(i) indirect, consequential or special loss; arising out of or relating to this Agreement.</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">12.3</span>
        <p>Subject to clauses 12.1 and 12.2, CI's total liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its subject matter and to anything which it has done or not done in connection with the same (whether from breach of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise) shall be limited, in respect of each 12-month period calculated from the Effective Date (each a “Contract Year”), to the total of all amounts paid by you under this Agreement during such Contract Year.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-4">13. Term and termination</h2>
        <span class="subheading">13.1</span>
        <p>This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall, unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms, continue for an initial term of the duration set out on the Ordering Document ("Initial Term") and thereafter renew automatically for successive terms of equivalent duration (each a "Renewal Term") unless and until terminated by either party giving the other not less than 30 days’ prior notice to that effect (such notice to expire at the end of the Initial Term or any subsequent Renewal Term only).</p>

        <span class="subheading">13.2</span>
        <p>Either party may terminate this Agreement, at any time, by giving the other written notice if the other:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>a) materially breaches any term of this Agreement and it is not possible to remedy that breach;</li>
          <li>b) materially breaches any term of this Agreement and it is possible to remedy that breach, but the other fails to do so within 30 days of being requested in writing to do so; or</li>
          <li>c) becomes insolvent, makes composition with its creditors, has a receiver or administrator of its undertaking or the whole or a substantial part of its assets appointed, or an is order made, or an effective resolution is passed, for its administration, receivership, liquidation, winding-up or other similar process, or has any distress, execution or other process levied or enforced against the whole or a substantial part of its assets (which is not discharged, paid out, withdrawn or removed within 28 days), or is subject to any proceedings which are equivalent or substantially similar to any of the foregoing under any applicable jurisdiction, or ceases to trade or threatens to do so.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the purposes of this clause 12.2, in order for it to be possible to remedy a breach it must be possible to take steps so as to put the other party into the same position which (save as to the date) it would have been in if the breach had never occurred.</p>

        <span class="subheading">13.3</span>
        <p>Without prejudice to clause 13.1, CI may, in addition, and without liability, terminate this Agreement, or alternatively, may suspend access to and use of any Product and/or the Service, by giving you written notice if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) any invoiced amount (not then-currently being disputed in good faith) is outstanding beyond the due date for payment;</li>
          <li>b) any provision of clause 3.3 is breached; and/or</li>
          <li>c) You are in persistent or repeated breach of any of your obligations under this Agreement (whether or not it is the same obligation that is breached and whether or not such breaches are remedied).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mb-4">14. Consequences of termination</h2>
        <span class="subheading">14.1</span>
        <p>Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) You shall immediately cease to access, and discontinue all use, of the Product(s) and Service; and</li>
          <li>b) all amounts payable to CI by you shall become immediately due and owing. For the avoidance of doubt, no refund of fees paid in advance shall be due in respect of any unexpired portion of the then-current term; and</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">14.2</span>
        <p>The termination of this Agreement for any reason will not affect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) any accrued rights or liabilities which either party may have by the time termination takes effect; or</li>
          <li>b) the coming into force or the continuation in force of any of its provisions that expressly or by implication are intended to come into force or continue in force on or after the termination. Without prejudice to the foregoing, clauses 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16 shall survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mb-4">15. Force majeure</h2>
        <p>Neither party will be liable to the other for any breach of this Agreement which arises because of any circumstances which the defaulting party cannot reasonably be expected to control (which shall include interruption or failure of the Internet or of any network, telecommunications, power supply or infrastructure, or any provider of any of the foregoing but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include shortage or lack of available funds), provided that the defaulting party:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) notifies the other in writing as soon as reasonably practicable about the nature and extent of the circumstances and likely breach;</li>
          <li>b) uses reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the circumstances and breach so as to minimise or avoid the breach;</li>
          <li>c) uses reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable; and</li>
          <li>d) could not have avoided the breach by taking steps that it ought reasonably to have taken in light of the matters known to it before the circumstances arose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mb-4">16. General</h2>
        <span class="subheading">16.1</span>
        <p>You may not sub-license or assign, sub-contract or delegate any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of TI.</p>

        <span class="subheading">16.2</span>
        <p>All notices and consents relating to this Agreement (but excluding any proceedings or other documents in any legal action) must be in writing. Notices must be sent to the address of the recipient set out in the Ordering Document or otherwise notified by the relevant party in accordance with this Agreement. Notices shall be sent by hand, by first class recorded delivery or registered post or other form of certified or registered mail, and shall be treated as having been delivered:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) if sent by hand, when delivered; and</li>
          <li>b) if sent by certified or registered mail, two days after the date of posting (or, if sent by air mail, seven days after the date of posting). </li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">16.3</span>
        <p>Unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing, if a party:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>a) fails to exercise or delays exercising or only exercises partially any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law; or</li>
          <li>b) agrees not to exercise or to delay exercising any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law;  then that party shall not be deemed to have waived and shall not be precluded or restricted from further exercising that or any other right or remedy.</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="subheading">16.4</span>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be ineffective or unenforceable, this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement or this Agreement as a whole. If any provision of this Agreement is so found to be ineffective or unenforceable but would be effective or enforceable if some part of the provision were deleted, the provision in question shall apply with such modification(s) as may be necessary to make it effective and enforceable.</p>

        <span class="subheading">16.5</span>
        <p>All variations to this Agreement must be agreed, set out in writing and signed on behalf of both parties before they take effect.</p>

        <span class="subheading">16.6</span>
        <p>Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides otherwise, nothing in this Agreement shall or is intended to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties, constitute one party as agent of the other or give either party authority to make or enter into commitments, assume liabilities or pledge credit on behalf of the other party. Neither party may act as if it were, or represent (expressly or by implying it) that it is, an agent of the other or has such authority.</p>

        <span class="subheading">16.7</span>
        <p>This Agreement sets out all of the terms that have been agreed between the parties in relation to the subjects covered by it, and supersedes all previous agreements between the parties relating to such subjects. Provided always that nothing in this clause will operate to limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, no other representations or terms shall apply or form part of this Agreement and each party acknowledges that it has not been influenced to enter this Agreement by, and shall have no rights or remedies (other than for breach of contract) in respect of, anything the other party has said or done or committed to do, except as expressly recorded in this Agreement.</p>

        <span class="subheading">16.8</span>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. Foreign laws do not apply, but CI is also entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce its Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
