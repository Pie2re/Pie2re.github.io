# How to book a meeting room online?

Are you looking for a meeting room in let's say New York? Alone in Manhattan you’ll find more than 1500 meeting rooms listed. To find the most suitable one can be a time-consuming challenge and a simple google search will just overwhelm you with options.  
In this article we’ll introduce you to the most reliable options in order to help you or your team select meeting rooms in a more efficient way. 

# 1. Things to consider 

Most importantly you’ll have to take into account: the size of your meeting. Especially for large meetings it is important to book a venue which gives enough space for the attendees to move around. Most conference centers and many hotels offer spaces for over 50 people whereas coworking spaces don’t often have these capacities. 

A second aspect to consider are the amenities included with the space. You should make sure that all tools you require are available and up to date. 
Another important aspect is the length of the meeting and the need for catering. If you’re planning a whole day meeting with short breaks it might be more suitable to book a hotel or conference center with a catering possibility. Often hotels are offering a tea and coffee supply throughout the day. 

# 2. Search online on a listing site

There are several professional listing sites available allowing you to choose the right meeting room corresponding to your needs. 

Generally these platforms aren’t charging a fee to do a search or booking of a meeting space. However, they will take a variable service fee from the meeting space provider for each successful booking. 

Most of the platforms include meeting rooms in conference centers, hotels and coworking spaces which are listed globally. Some sites have limited geographical coverage. 

Here goes a collection of sites that you can use to find the best coworking space for your needs:

# 3. Search on google

Searching for a meeting room on google will first of all lead you to the already mentioned listing sites, naturally ranked meeting spaces and spaces that rank due to paid ads
Both are important, new spaces will generally not rank naturally at first and may be willing to advertise their space by paid ads, while existing spaces, with a longer history of being opened will tend to naturally rank high. 

It is important to search for the specific type of facility such as “Business Hotels” or “Conference Center” in order to receive the best rate available. In almost every case will you receive the best available rate or discounts by booking directly with the location. 

# 4. Look up on social medias 👀

Meetings and Events leave their marks on social media which makes it easy to find meeting locations on instagram or twitter. Searching for keywords or specific hashtags will help you to not only validate your primary search but also to get a better idea of the offer (layout, furniture, community, etc.). Videos and pictures shared by other customers will give you a better impression and help you save time visiting the space. Additionally, social media can help you to discover new spaces in your area.
